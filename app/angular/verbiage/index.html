            <li>
                At EverFitâ„¢, it wasn't enough for us to just have a cool site, we think some Customer Loyalty Rewards are in order! EverFit will stack "lbs" on your dumbbells as you make purchases on the network,  just like how many credit cards offer rewards for using their card... same difference!  Keep stacking the pounds and use them as store credit towards any of the EverFit offerings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Affiliate program: As an EverFit Fanatic, you automatically get points/pounds from your own purchases, which is awesome, but in addition to that,  you can earn additional rewards simply by "sharing" EverFit VIA your EverFit "Share Link" found in your settings. Yep! Free stuff for sharing Good Health & Wellness! You can email, text, post to social media, and pretty much use your link in any electronic means of distribution.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you're not a rewards kind of person, don't sweat it! We'll make sure the word gets out! Live EverFit!</p>
