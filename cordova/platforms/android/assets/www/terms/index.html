<h1>SECTION 2 – ENROLLMENT, BUSINESS STRUCTURES AND TRANSFERS</h1>

<h2>2.1. BECOMING A EVERFIT PROMOTER</h2>
<p>To become an EverFit Promoter, simply submit a properly completed Promoter Application & Promoter’s Agreement to EverFit. No product or inventory purchase by the EverFit Promoter is required and there are no other fees or costs, except for an annual renewal fee of $149. The renewal fee is to offset costs incurred by EverFit for educational development costs and materials which are provided to you free of charge. After the Application is accepted and the agreement has been completed, EverFit will register you as an EverFit Promoter and provide you with a non-transferable EverFit ID. Incomplete Promoter Application(s) & Agreement(s) will not be processed. EverFit reserves the right to reject any new or renewal application.</p>

<h2>2.2 ONLINE APPLICATIONS</h2>
<p>The online applicant should personally submit the application on EverFit’s Website at www.LiveEverFit.com.</p>


<h2>2.3. SOCIAL SECURITY OR TAX ID NUMBER REQUIRED</h2>
<p>In order for EverFit to comply with IRS regulations, we must have
a Social Security number or Federal Tax ID number to provide the required 1099 reporting. This information is held in strictest confidence and used only to comply with governing laws and for protection of your EverFit business.</p>

<h2>2.4. BUSINESS ENTITIES</h2>
<p>A corporation, limited liability company, partnership or trust (collectively referred to as a “Business Entity”) may apply to be an EverFit Promoter by submitting a properly completed Promoter Application & Promoter Agreement. It is the responsibility of the Business Entity to have its own bylaws or operating agreement to govern the rights and relationship between the participants. The following rules apply to all Business Entities:</p>

<p>• The Promoter Agreement must be signed by all of the shareholders, members, partners, trustees or any person holding an ownership interest or management position in the Business Entity (collectively “Participants”). If there are more than one Participants of the Business Entity so that an online agreement is not possible, a physical agreement must be completed by request of EverFit. Participants are jointly and severally liable for any indebtedness or other obligations to EverFit.</p>

<p>• One individual must be designated by the Business Entity to receive recognition or to participate in incentive awards on behalf of the Business Entity. This individual shall be designated as the authorized company contact, or the “Contact Person.” The Contact Person is the Participant in the Business Entity who is designated by the Business Entity to receive communications, recognition, and non-divisible forms of remuneration from EverFit.</p>

<p>• An EverFit Promoter operating his or her business as a sole proprietorship may change the form of her business to a partnership, limited liability company, corporation or trust, or from one type of entity to another so long as the original EverFit Promoter remains the Contact Person for the Business Entity. A $100.00 change fee will be charged for each entity change.</p>

<p>• The conduct of any Participant is imputed to the Business Entity as a whole. Therefore, if any one Participant violates the Promoter Agreement or EverFit’s Policies and Procedures, the misconduct of that Participant shall be imputed to the Business Entity.</p>

<h2>2.5. DISSOLUTION OF BUSINESS ENTITIES</h2>
<p>In preparing to dissolve a Business Entity, arrangements must be made. If the separating parties engage in a dispute over the disposition of the business, or fail to provide for the best interests of other EverFit Promoters and/or EverFit, EverFit may, in its sole discretion, terminate the Promoter Agreement.</p>

<p>While preparing to dissolve a Business Entity, and during the dissolution process, business must be conducted as follows:</p>

<p>• The Contact Person may, with consent of the Participant(s), operate the EverFit business pursuant to an assignment in writing whereby the relinquishing Participants authorize EverFit to deal directly and solely with the Contact Person. All commissions, recognition and other remuneration and rewards will be issued in the name of the Contact Person.</p>

<p>• The Participants may continue to operate the EverFit business jointly on a “business-as-usual” basis, whereupon all compensation paid by EverFit will be paid according to the status quo as it existed prior to the dissolution proceedings. This is the default procedure if the parties do not agree on the format set forth above.</p>

<p>•, Under no circumstances will EverFit split commission or bonus checks between Participants in dissolving entities. Remuneration shall always be issued to the same individual or entity.</p>

<p>• The former Participants of a Business Entity that relinquished its interest in the EverFit business must wait twelve (12) calendar months before they are permitted to again become EverFit Promoters.</p>

<h2>2.6. CANCELLATION AND RE-APPLICATION</h2>
<p>A EverFit Promoter may legitimately change organizations by voluntarily canceling his or her EverFit business and remaining inactive (i.e. no blog updates, no attendance at any EverFit functions, participation in any other form of EverFit Promoter activity, or operation of any other EverFit business) for twelve (12) full calendar months. Following the twelve-month period of inactivity, the former EverFit Promoter may reapply.</p>

<h2>2.7. SALE, TRANSFER, OR ASSIGNMENT OF AN EVERFIT BUSINESS</h2>
<p>Each EverFit Promoter’s business relationship to EverFit is a personal relationship. To ensure that this personal relationship remains intact, EverFit Promoters may not sell, assign, or otherwise transfer an EverFit business to any third party. Any attempt to sell, assign or otherwise transfer to a third party will terminate the Promoter’s Agreement.</p>

<h2>2.8. SUCCESSION – INHERITANCE OR INCAPACITATION</h2>
<p>Upon the death or legally adjudicated incapacitation of an EverFit
Promoter, the Promoter’s Agreement will be terminated and the Promoter’s existing business will be absorbed by EverFit.</p>
<h2>2.9. ONE BUSINESS PER PROMOTER</h2>
<p>Promoters may have an interest in only one EverFit business. There may be two or more EverFit independent businesses per
Immediate Household (the Primary Promoter and one or more Business(es) so long as the following criteria are satisfied:</p>
<p>• No one under the age of 18 may be a EverFit Promoter and have an EverFit business; and</p>
<p>• The Business(es) each must be a bona fide independent business that is operated by the person listed on the EverFit Promoter Application
and Promoter Agreement and not by the owner of the other Business. An “Immediate Household” includes spouses, cohabitating couples,
and children over the age of 18 and relatives residing in the same dwelling. Also included in the definition are students attending
boarding school or college that reside at school or college during the school year, but within the dwelling of their parents or other
relatives during non-school periods. Persons such as roommates and tenants who are unrelated shall not fall within the definition of an
“Immediate Household” and may each have their own EverFit independent business.</p>

<h2>2.10. DIVORCE ACTIONS</h2>
<p>In divorce cases, EverFit shall treat the spouse whose name is on the Promoter Agreement as the owner of the business. Under no circumstances will EverFit divide commissions, bonuses, recognition, or other rewards, nor will EverFit divide commissions between spouses. Upon the entry of a final divorce decree, the former spouse may apply as a EverFit Promoter under any line of sponsorship, and need not comply with the 12 calendar month inactivity requirement before reapplying.</p>

<h2>2.11. REQUESTS FOR RECORDS</h2>
<p>Any request from an EverFit Promoter for copies of invoices, applications, or other records will require a fee of $1.00 per page per copy. This fee covers the expense of mailing and time required to research files and make copies of the records.</p>

<h1>SECTION 3 – OPERATING YOUR EVERFIT BUSINESS</h1>

<h2>3.7.1. OTHER SELLING ACTIVITIES</h2>
<p>EverFit Promoters may engage in other business ventures, including selling activities related to non-EverFit products, services or business opportunities if they desire to do so, but they may not take advantage of their knowledge of, or association with, other EverFit Promoters whom they did not personally sponsor in order to promote or sell such non-EverFit products, services or opportunities.

<h2>3.7.2. CROSS-COMPANY ENTICEMENT</h2>
<p>During the term of an EverFit Promoter’s Agreement and all renewals thereof, and for a period of one year after termination, cancellation or expiration of the EverFit Promoter’s Agreement for any reason, each EverFit Promoter shall not encourage or attempt to influence or induce an EverFit Promoter to cancel or alter his or her relationship with EverFit.

<p>In addition, if an EverFit Promoter appears in, is referenced in, or allows his or her name or likeness to be featured or referenced in any promotional, recruiting or solicitation materials for another Fitness or fitness-related company during the term of the EverFit Promoter’s Agreement and all renewals thereof, this shall constitute Enticement for purposes of this Section 3.7.2.</p>

<p>The provisions of this Section 3.7 shall survive the termination, cancellation or expiration of the Agreement.</p>

<h2>3.8. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</h2>

They are provided to EverFit Promoter by EverFit in strictest confidence and are made available to EverFit Promoters for the sole purpose of supporting their Clients and the EverFit Promoters to further develop their EverFit business. Every EverFit Promoter who is provided such information must treat it as confidential and take care to maintain its secrecy and refrain from making any use thereof for any purpose other than the management of his EverFit business.</p>

<p>As a result of your position as a EverFit Promoter, you will have access to confidential information that you acknowledge to be proprietary, highly sensitive and valuable to EverFit’s business, which information is being made available to you solely and exclusively for purposes of furthering the sale of EverFit products and prospecting, training and recruiting third parties who wish to become Clients or EverFit Promoters, and to further build and promote your EverFit business.</p>

<p>The EverFit Promoter and EverFit agree that, but for this agreement of confidentiality and nondisclosure, EverFit would not provide these Reports or other EverFit confidential information to the EverFit Promoter.

<p>2. Directly or indirectly disclose the password or other access code to his or her Blog or EverFit legal documents;</p>
<p>3. Use any EverFit confidential information to compete with EverFit, engage in activity in violation of Section 3.7 or for any purpose other than promoting EverFit; nor</p>
<p>4. Use or disclose to any person, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity any information contained in any Activity Report obtained while the Agreement was in effect.</p>

<p>The provisions of this Section 3.8 shall survive the termination, cancellation or expiration of the Promoter Agreement.</p>

<h2>3.9. REMEDIES FOR DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND VIOLATION OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</h2>
<p>Each EverFit Promoter acknowledges that EverFit would suffer irreparable harm as a result of any unauthorized disclosure or use of EverFit’s confidential information, including any Reports, or recruitment or solicitation of EverFit Promoters for another fitness-related company in violation of Sections 3.7 and 3.8, and that monetary damages are insufficient to compensate EverFit for such harm. Therefore, if any EverFit Promoter is in breach of these Sections, EverFit is entitled to an injunction or temporary restraining order, without notice to such EverFit Promoter, restraining any unauthorized disclosure or use of the confidential information or any recruiting or soliciting in violation of Sections 3.7 or 3.8 in addition to any other available remedy, including damages. In any such action, if EverFit prevails, each EverFit Promoter agrees that he or she will reimburse EverFit for its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with taking the legal action. As to EverFit, EverFit Promoters waive all bonding requirements otherwise applicable to a temporary restraining order and/or injunction.</p>

<p>The provisions of this Section 3.9 shall survive the termination, cancellation or expiration of the Agreement.</p>

<p>EverFit reserves the right to prohibit an EverFit Promoter’s ability to sell through a commercial outlet if the EverFit Promoter or outlet is presented, or engages, in any activity that in EverFit’s sole discretion is not in EverFit’s best interests.</p>

<h1>SECTION 10 – INACTIVITY AND CANCELLATION</h1>

<h2>10.1. EFFECT OF SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION</h2>
<p>An EverFit Promoter’s bonuses and commissions constitute the entire consideration for the EverFit Promoter’s efforts in generating sales and all activities related to generating sales. Following an EverFit Promoter’s non-renewal of his or her Agreement, cancellation of the Agreement for inactivity, or voluntary cancellation or involuntary termination of the Agreement (all of these methods are collectively referred to as “termination”), An EverFit Promoter whose business is terminated will lose all rights as an EverFit Promoter and his or her EverFit business will be canceled. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of the right to sell EverFit products and services, to participate in EverFit’s functions or events, and to receive future commissions, bonuses, awards or other income resulting from the sales. Terminated EverFit Promoters have no right to compensation or damages from EverFit. In the event of termination, Promoters agree to waive all rights they may have, including but not limited to any bonuses, commissions or other remuneration derived from the sales after the date of the activities causing such termination.</p>

<p>Suspended EverFit Promoters are not permitted to attend EverFit functions, engage in any EverFit related activities, recruit EverFit Promoters, or sell EverFit products so long as the suspension remains in effect, nor are they eligible to participate in EverFit’s compensation plan or receive commissions from EverFit while the suspension is in effect. If an EverFit Promoter’s Agreement is terminated following a suspension, the termination date is retroactive to the date of suspension, and the former EverFit Promoter shall have no right to recover commissions held during the suspension period. If EverFit determines that it is appropriate to reinstate a suspended</p>
<p>EverFit Promoter, EverFit may, at its discretion, impose disciplinary sanctions as set forth in these Policies & Procedures as a condition of reinstating the suspended EverFit Promoter.</p>

<p>When termination occurs for any reason, an EverFit Promoter must wait 12 calendar months from the date of termination before reapplying as an EverFit Promoter. It is left to EverFit’s discretion whether to accept any individual who has previously been terminated. Suspension and termination are retroactive to the beginning of the calendar month in which the alleged wrongful conduct occurred for which the suspension is imposed by EverFit.</p>

<p>In addition to the indemnification obligations set forth in these Policies & Procedures, an EverFit Promoter who is involuntarily terminated for violation of the Agreement, or who voluntarily terminates his or her Agreement to avoid an involuntary termination or other disciplinary sanction, shall, upon demand by EverFit, be liable to repay, return or compensate EverFit for any benefit programs, prizes, incentives, commissions, bonuses or other remuneration received from EverFit after the date of the activities causing such termination, as well as any other damages resulting to EverFit from such conduct.</p>

<h2>10.2. CANCELLATION FOR INACTIVITY</h2>
<p>If a EverFit Promoter has not renewed and has been inactive (no personal purchases or sales) during a 12 consecutive calendar month period, he or she will be cancelled as an EverFit Promoter on the first business day of the 13th month of inactivity. At this time, all rights are relinquished. After cancellation has occurred in the 13th month, he or she will be eligible to submit a new Promoter Application, under the sponsor of their choice, and a new EverFit ID will be issued.</p>

<h2>10.3. AGREEMENT TERMINABLE AT WILL</h2>
<p>An EverFit Promoter may terminate his or her relationship with EverFit at any time by providing a signed written notice to EverFit. EverFit may also terminate the relationship with an EverFit Promoter (including any partnerships, corporations or other entity) at any time by providing written notice.</p>

<p>EverFit Promoters or EverFit are not required to have any reason, nor do EverFit Promoters or EverFit have to claim or prove any cause to terminate this relationship. A termination will be effective after the terminating party sends to the other, by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, or UPS, FedEx, etc. a written notice of intent to terminate at the expiration of Thirty (30) days from the date upon which such notice is mailed to the other. Such termination will then occur at the end of the Thirty (30) day notice period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be able to terminate such agreements immediately, without the sending of the aforesaid written Thirty (30) day notice, upon the death or bankruptcy of a sales representative or promoter, or in the event of a breach of an agreement.</p>

<p>If and when the relationship is terminated, EverFit Promoters shall have no claim against EverFit nor any right to claim or collect lost profits, lost opportunities or any other damages. Termination will result in the loss of all benefits as an EverFit Promoter.</p>

<p>If an EverFit Promoter’s relationship with EverFit is terminated, he or she may not re-enroll in EverFit under a new Sponsor until 12 calendar months have elapsed from the date on which the relationship was terminated or the date on which the EverFit Promoter placed his or her last order with EverFit, whichever is later. EverFit reserves the right to reject any re-enrollment application. EverFit makes no promises or assurances that the relationship with any EverFit Promoter will continue for any period or term.</p>

<h1>SECTION 12 - GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION, VENUE, MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION</h1>

<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas applicable to contracts made and to be carried out in Texas (without regard to principles of conflict of laws).

Other than any claim for injunctive or equitable relief under these Policies and Procedures, any dispute or controversy arising out of or in relation to this Agreement shall first be submitted to mediation in the City of Houston, Texas in accordance with the Commercial Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association. If mediation fails to resolve such dispute or controversy, then such dispute or controversy shall be determined and settled by arbitration in the City of Houston, Texas, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree to use good faith efforts to select a mediator and, if mediation fails to resolve such dispute or controversy, an arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree upon a mediator or arbitrator, such mediator or arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the relevant Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Any payments that would otherwise become due under this Agreement that are the subject of a dispute may be delayed to the extent required for purposes of avoiding additional taxes, interest or penalties. Whenever any action is required to be taken under this Agreement within a specified period of time and the taking of such action is materially affected by a matter submitted to mediation or arbitration, such period shall automatically be extended by the number of days plus ten that are taken for the determination of that matter by the parties through mediation or otherwise by the arbitrator.

Without limiting the requirements of this Section, any judicial proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the Federal Courts having jurisdiction and sitting in Houston, Texas. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN HOUSTON, TEXAS, FOR THE PURPOSES OF ANY JUDICIAL SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE AND CONSENT THAT, IN ADDITION TO ANY METHODS OF SERVICE OF PROCESS PROVIDED FOR UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN HOUSTON, TEXAS MAY BE MADE BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, AND SERVICE SHALL BE COMPLETE ON THE DELIVERY OR ATTEMPTED DELIVERY AS EVIDENCED BY THE RETURN RECEIPT. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY IN ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN HOUSTON, TEXAS AND FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. This provision may be filed with any court as written evidence of the knowing and voluntary irrevocable agreement among the Parties to waive any objections to jurisdiction, to venue or to convenience of forum. The foregoing consents to jurisdiction and appointments of agents to receive service of process shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Texas for any purpose except as provided above and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties to this Agreement. If any such proceeding is necessary to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, including any claim or demand, or to interpret this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other Party reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, expenses and necessary disbursements in addition to any other relief to which it may otherwise be entitled, whether or not such action or proceeding is prosecuted to judgment.

Notwithstanding this mediation and arbitration policy, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction in the county and state of the EverFit corporate office in the United States, or in any other jurisdiction as necessary to enforce an arbitration award or the injunctive relief granted by a court, or to seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to ensure that the relief sought in arbitration is not rendered ineffectual during the pendency of, or after the rendition of, a decision in any arbitration proceeding. The institution of any action for equitable relief or to enforce an award or order shall not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit any claim seeking relief other than injunctive or enforcement relief to arbitration. Judgment upon the award may be entered by the United States District Court or state trial court located in the county and state of the EverFit corporate office in the United States, or application may be made to such court for the judicial acceptance of the award and order of enforcement, as the case may be, if the arbitrator’s award or decision is not complied with within seven days of the arbitrator’s decision.

The existence of any claim or cause of action of an EverFit Promoter against EverFit whether predicated on the Promoter Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a defense to EverFit’s enforcement of an EverFit Promoter’s covenants and agreements contained herein or under the Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate shall survive any termination or expiration of any other agreements between the parties.</p>

From your first day with EverFit™ you can begin to earn income.

<p>I have spoken with many Trainers who currently have their own training website and many of them have the same issues:</p>
<p>o	It’s a great way to diversify the time available in each day to generate addition income, but trying to create a nationally recognized brand is very expensive and near impossible for one trainer to do on their own. Most of the Trainer’s branded clothing line ends up being a T-shirt with a logo on it, which was cool for a couple weeks; then became a headache and not worth the effort over time.</p>
<p>o	A typical individual Trainer’s site will never be seen by the vast majority of potential Clients that are looking for a Personal Trainer and an all-inclusive training website. With thousands of training websites it’s easy for most of these individual sites to become lost within the worldwide sea of fitness and training sites. By combining the marketability of these individual sites into one singular marketing force along with a complete fitness storefront, EverFit™ will become a nationally recognized brand very quickly.</p>
<p>o	Daily maintenance of a website can be more time consuming and costly than initially anticipated. Very often their website ends up being outdated and unproductive in general.</p>

<p>By providing all of the upfront and continual maintenance costs for the website as well as a storefront, LiveEverFit.com allows the Trainers to concentrate on what they do best—training their Clients. Our goal is to maximize each Trainer’s income potential. With our help, Trainers can make an unlimited amount of passive income through commissions paid from product sales on the LiveEverfit.com website. This, in addition to our global advertising, will ensure that LiveEverFit.com becomes a mainstream website, not just another individual training site.</p>

<h1>Trainer’s Compensation:</h1>

<p>The tools LiveEverFit.com provides will help each Trainer with personal promotion by giving them a professional brand to represent and the marketing tools to allow an unlimited second income stream through online sales. This will truly maximize each Personal Trainer’s income potential through:</p>
<p>o	online purchases of fitness products by Basic Subscribers</p>
<p>o	individual online Clients who have become Tier 2, 3, 4 and 5 Subscribers</p>
<p>o	in-person training sales from the Subscribers who live in your area</p>

<p>Each Trainer will receive monthly commissions for online sales and from Tier 2, 3, 4 and 5 Subscribers as soon as their videos are posted on the website and as long as they maintain active training status. Basic Subscribers will not have access to the Trainer’s personal contact information. Each subscriber will have the option to have direct communication with the Trainer of their choice, once per month, in order to have fitness routines/nutrition customized to their needs or goals by upgrading their Basic Subscription to Tier 2 Subscription for $45 per month. Each subscriber can also upgrade to a Tier 3 subscription for $175 per month in order to get one on one customized diet and exercise training once a week. A client can choose to upgrade to a Tier 4 subscription for $350 per month in order to get one on one customized diet and exercise training two times per week or a Tier 4 subscription for $500 per month to get full on Contest Prep coaching or unlimited access and coaching. In addition, IF a Tier 2, 3, 4 or 5 subscriber wants to be trained in person, EverFit does not ask for any of that income, so 100% of that income is the Trainer’s to keep as additional incentive to promote our online products and services.</p>

<p>To be an active Trainer, you must complete the Application Process. You also have the option to purchase our state of the art Video Package for $1500. Which include (5) completed videos uploaded to the Trainers blog inside the EverFit™ website. See Terms and Conditions for video timeline and structure requirements. To remain an Active Trainer once the videos are loaded your total sales must be at least $100 per month and you must renew you membership annually for $149. Every trainer I have spoken to says that just one of their clients could spend easily 2x this amount monthly, so this should not serve as a deterrent to anyone serious about the opportunity.</p>

<p>Passive income generators:</p>
<p>1) Active Trainers will receive (5%) commission on all “EverFit” clothing, Equipment, Supplements, music and LIVE class sales.</p>
<p>2) Active Trainers will receive $25 per month from every Tier 2 Subscribers that they are providing individual online training/nutrition programs for.</p>
<p>3) Active Trainers will receive $75 per month from every Tier 3 Subscriber.</p>
<p>4) Active Trainers will receive $250 per month form every Tier 4 Subscriber.</p>
<p>5) Active Trainers will receive $350 per month from every Tier 5 Subscriber.</p>
<p>6) Additional income made from Personal Training outside of the LiveEverFit.com website is an added bonus provided by the EverFit™ marketing that is the Trainer’s to keep.</p>
<p>7) Monthly and annual cash bonuses to be paid to each Promoter based on exceeding sales goals.</p>
<p>8) Active Trainers have the opportunity to acquire retail sales for our EverFit™ clothing line, for which a 5% sales commission would be paid for all orders. This includes sales to Gym’s, Boutiques, Department Stores and any other retail selling location.</p>

<p>What you get in your Welcome Package:</p>
<p>So the simple question is, do you want to make money in your sleep? If so, the best way to do that is generate passive income. And the best way to do that in the fitness industry is on the web is with Live Ever Fit. Working with EverFit™ we provide the tools to maximize your income potential with your current clients, current social media followers AND also puts you on our nationwide fitness platform that will set you apart from any other trainer no on the Ever Fit team.

So for the same price as a cheap website you will get your own fitness back office and storefront worth hundreds of thousands and have professional videos made to distinguish yourself from others while enhancing your own brand!
